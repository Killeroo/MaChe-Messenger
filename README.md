MaChe Messenger

MaChe is a small simple messenging application written in C#. it is designed to send text and images (drawn and written within the client ) to other clients on a LAN network.

All that is required is MaChe server running on the network then multiple clients can connect and chat.

The project is currently in early development but some core functionality has been implemented.

As of the current build the following has been implemented:
- Text chat between clients 
- Clients can safetly connect and disconnect from server

Following to be added in branch next merge:
- Paint style drawing functionality added within client
- Options for connecting client to server (has to be done manually atm)
- Images can be sent between clients

Future features:
- Auto finding server option for clients
- Username creation for clients
